    <summary>A lightweight free Spotify 🎧 crossplatform-client 🖥📱 which handles playback manually, streams music using Youtube &amp; no Spotify premium account is needed 😱</summary>
    <description>
    Spotube is a Flutter based lightweight spotify client. It utilizes the power 
    of Spotify  &amp; Youtube's public API  &amp; creates a hazardless, performant  &amp; resource
    friendly User Experience

    # Features
    - Open Source
    - No telementry, diagnostics or user data collection
    - Lightweight  &amp; resource friendly
    - Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
    - Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
    - Small size  &amp; less data hungry
    - No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public  &amp; free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)
    - Lyrics
    - Downloadable track (WIP)
